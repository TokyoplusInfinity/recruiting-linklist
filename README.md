# Recruiting Linklist

Inspired by [Sjamilla's](https://github.com/Sjamilla) awesome [awesome-recruitment repository](https://github.com/Sjamilla/awesome-recruitment) I plan on making all my collected links to tools, blogs, newsletter etc. public for everyone who is interested. 

Ongoing project with regular updates.

Some advice first: If you have limited time to keep up with everything going on in the Recruitment World, make [Hung Lee's Recruiting Brainfood Newsletter](http://www.recruitingbrainfood.com/) the one thing you read every week.

As a Tech Recruiter these [Resources](https://github.com/gf-nl/recruiting-linklist/blob/master/tech-ressources.md) help me to strenghten my technical background.

Also: Looking for something to read? Have a look at my recommended [Articles](https://github.com/gf-nl/recruiting-linklist/blob/master/articles.md)
