# Recruiting Linklist

Inspired by [Sjamilla's](https://github.com/Sjamilla) awesome [awesome-recruitment repository](https://github.com/Sjamilla/awesome-recruitment) I plan on making all my collected links to tools, blogs, newsletter etc. public for everyone who is interested. 

Ongoing project with regular updates.

As a Tech Recruiter these [Resources](https://github.com/gf-nl/recruiting-linklist/blob/master/tech-ressources.md) help me to strenghten my technical background.
